Instead this tool was designed to provide data to support conservation planning efforts across the Gulf Coast Region. All users acknowledge that the CPT model is intended to explore ecological and socioeconomic co-benefits of proposed areas of land conservation, and should not be used in a decision making context. The flexibility of this tool enables a user to evaluate conservation alternatives using either a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework, or user-defined values. This book is intended to provide additional support documents for the data measures used in the CPT tool. "],

A ToU score of zero indicates the AOI is already urbanized. A ToU score of one indicates that there is absolutely no threat of urbanization. A ToU score between zero and one indicates the predicted likelihood of threat in decreasing order.

Utility Function: higher the better linear Hex Aggregation: Maximum Area of Interest Aggregation: The project area of interest is composed of multiple hexagons; the score for the area of interest is the maximum score from the hexagons inside the polygon. Threshold: 7.4 Access &amp; Recreation: Number of Access Points RESTORE Goal: Gulf Economy – Priority Attribute: Access and Recreation DEFINITION This measure indicates the number of points within a 25 km buffer radius of a hexagon, where the public can access places to engage in outdoor recreation, including boat ramps and access points to parks, wildlife management areas, wildlife refuges, and national estuarine research reserves. Besides boat ramps, access points to protected areas were identified by intersections between roadways and protected areas listed under the Protected Areas Database for the United States (PAD-US) 2.0 (Gergeley 2016). Roadways were acquired from the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER)/Line Shapefile by the United States Census Bureau (USCB) (U.S. DOC 2019). Public boat ramps were obtained from the Florida Fish &amp; Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) (FL-FWCC 2019), Alabama Dept. of Natural Resources (ALDNR) (AL-DOCNR 2019), Mississippi Dept. of Marine Resources (MDMR) (MS-DOMR 2019), Louisiana Dept. of Wildlife &amp; Fisheries (LDWF) (LA-DOWF 2019), and Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Dept. (TPWD) (TX-PWD 2019).

Unit: Count Work Flow: Clip the access points data to hexagon boundaries. Create a 25 km buffer around the centroid of each hexagon. Obtain the counts of access points that intersect with the 25 km buffer of each hexagon. Figure 7.4: Work flow for Access and Recreation: Number of Access Points. Utility Function: The fewer access points the better for conservation (lower the better). This measure reflects opportunities to provide access where it is currently limited. Hex Aggregation: Area of Interest Aggregation: The project area of interest is composed of multiple hexagons; the score for the area of interest is the maximum score from the hexagons inside the polygon.
